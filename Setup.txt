For setup in your computer



1) For Frontend


->> Download nodejs from official website
https://nodejs.org/en/download/current
--> download windows msi and run it normally as we install for other files
--> In cmd check whether node and npm are installed properly with 
    node -v
    npm -v
commands. It should return the versions
 
#npx create-react-app rentify-frontend

Then run these commands

cd rentify-frontend
npm install
npm install react-router-dom
npm start

For running Frontend::
npm start

Keep this running in one cmd


Open another cmd for backend
2) For Backend
python -m pip install Django
python -m pip install virtualenv      
python -m virtualenv venv             or    virtualenv env
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install django mysqlclient
#django-admin startproject rentify-backend
cd rentify-backend
pip install --only-binary :all: mysqlclient
pip install djangorestframework
#python manage.py startapp rentify
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver


After setup is done for both frontend and backend you can Open two terminals. No need to do everything again

In one terminal : python manage.py runserver
In one terminal : npm start

whenever you change anything in models. Run these three commands
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
